/*
The Challenge

First, you mash in a random large number to start with. Then, repeatedly do the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, divide it by 3.

If it's not, either add 1 or subtract 1 (to make it divisible by 3), then divide it by 3.

The game stops when you reach "1".

Challenge Description
The input is a single number: the number at which the game starts. Write a program that plays the Threes game, and outputs a valid sequence of steps you need to take to get to 1. Each step should be output as the number you start at, followed by either -1 or 1 (if you are adding/subtracting 1 before dividing), or 0 (if you are just dividing). The last line should simply be 1. Input Description
The input is a single number: the number at which the game starts. 100
Output Description
The output is a list of valid steps that must be taken to play the game. Each step is represented by the number you start at, followed by either -1 or 1 (if you are adding/subtracting 1 before dividing), or 0 (if you are just dividing). The last line should simply be 1.

The output is not ideal, as it should not be floats. I'm going to look at this a little more.
